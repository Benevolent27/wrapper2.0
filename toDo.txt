1.  Make it so the pattern matching supports # comments
2.  Make it so the pattern matching for allowable text looks like:

3. Make it so the wrapper.sh will load up all the patterns, similar to how the filter does, but instead will run each one on $line, and then run the appropriate script in the /mods/default/ folder.
